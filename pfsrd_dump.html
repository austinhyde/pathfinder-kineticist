<h3><a name="TOC-Simple-Blasts"></a>Simple Blasts</h3>
<p>A kineticist gains a simple blast from her primary element at 1st level—some elements offer more than one option.</p>
<p>When a kineticist gains a new element via the expanded element class feature, she gains a simple blast from that element as well. Each simple blast is either a physical blast or an energy blast.</p>
<p>Physical blasts are ranged attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6+1 + the kineticist's <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier, increasing by 1d6+1 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st. Spell resistance doesn't apply against physical blasts. Energy blasts are ranged touch attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the kineticist's <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier, increasing by 1d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.</p>

  <p><b>Blast Type</b>: physical; <b>Damage</b> bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing</p>
  <p>You throw a nearby unattended object at a single foe as a ranged attack. The object must weigh no more than 5 pounds per kineticist level you possess. If the attack hits, the target and the thrown object each take the blast's damage. Since the object is enfolded in strands of aether, even if you use this power on a magic weapon or other unusual object, the attack doesn't use any of the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-weapon" style="font-style:italic">magic weapon's</a> bonuses or effects; it simply deals your blast damage. Alternatively, you can loosen the strands of aether in order to deal damage to both the object and the target as though you had thrown the object yourself (instead of dealing your normal blast damage).</p>
  <p>You substitute your <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier for your <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> modifier if throwing the object would have added your <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> modifier on the damage roll, and you don't take the –4 penalty on the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack roll</a> for throwing an object that wasn't designed to be thrown. In this case, the object's special effects apply (including effects from its materials), and if the object is a weapon, you must be proficient with it and able to wield it with one hand; otherwise, the item deals damage as a one-handed improvised weapon for a creature of your size.</p>

<h3><a name="TOC-Composite-Blasts"></a>Composite Blasts</h3>
<p>Composite blasts combine elements to form a new blast. When a kineticist gains a new element through expanded element, she gains access to all composite blasts for which she qualifies.</p>
<p>Most composite blasts are either physical or energy blasts, like simple blasts. Physical composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6+2 + the kineticist's <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier, increasing by 2d6+2 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st; energy composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6 + 1/2 the kineticist's <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier, increasing by 2d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.</p>

If an attack deals less damage than you still have as <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> from force ward, it still reduces those <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss. These <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/regenerate" style="font-style:italic">regenerate</a> at a rate of 1 per minute.

Whenever you accept burn while using an aether wild talent, you siphon some of the energy from the aether flowing through you and your force ward recovers a number of <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> equal to your character level, up to its current maximum. You can dismiss or restore your force ward as an <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>, but doing so doesn't change the number of <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> available, and the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> don't recover while this ability is inactive.</p>

A creature in a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> with you takes double this amount of damage at the end of each of its turns.</p>
  <p>Weapons that strike you also take this damage, though the damage is unlikely to penetrate the weapon's <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment---final/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a>. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase this damage by 1 point per 4 kineticist levels you possess until the next time your burn is removed. You can increase the damage in this way up to seven times.</p>
  <p>Whenever you accept burn while using a fire wild talent, the surging flame causes your searing flesh to deal double its current amount of damage for 1 round (a creature in a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> with you takes a total of four times as much damage as normal).

  <p>You infuse the ground in a 20-foot radius anywhere within 120 feet of you on an earthen surface (if you are using a metal blast, this infusion affects a metal surface instead). The ground roils and buckles beneath the affected area. All creatures and objects in contact with the ground within the area when you create it automatically take 1/4 of the normal damage from your blast with no saving throw. Any time a creature enters the area, it takes half the normal damage from your blast, as do creatures that end their turns in the area. The entire area counts as difficult terrain.

  <p>You can use force to rip your targets apart.

Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> by the blast is disintegrated, as the spell <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disintegrate" style="font-style:italic">disintegrate</a>.

  <p>You can drain elemental energy and matter from your foes to strengthen your next attack. When you use this infusion, your kinetic blast affects only creatures with a subtype matching your kinetic blast's element (for instance, a fire blast would damage only creatures of the fire subtype). Against such creatures, your blast targets <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> AC (if it requires an <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack roll</a>) and always allows <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>. Because you are draining energy from the target, your blast doesn't apply your elemental overflow bonuses or <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier. The target can attempt a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to take 1/4 the normal amount of damage. Draining infusion ignores any <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>, resistances, and immunities the creature might possess. If at least one creature fails its saving throw against your draining infusion, you can reduce the total burn cost of any one blast wild talent used before the end of your next turn by 1, or by 2 if you have the supercharge ability. If you use draining infusion again before applying this reduction, you still deal the damage from that draining infusion, but the burn reductions don't stack.</p>

  <p>Instead of a single kinetic blast, you shoot two kinetic blasts at targets within 120 feet that each deal damage as if your kineticist level were 1st (effects or abilities that increase your kinetic blast's damage don't apply). At 10th level, you can shoot three blasts with flurry of blasts; this increases to four blasts at 16th level and to five blasts at 20th level. If you are under the effect of <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste" style="font-style:italic">haste</a> or similar magic that increases your number of attacks in a full-attack action, the number of kinetic blasts in your flurry of blasts increases by 1.</p>
  <p>No two targets can be more than 30 feet apart. You must assign the targets of all your blasts before rolling any of the attacks. Any blast beyond the first that hits the same target adds 1d6 points of damage; bonuses and penalties to damage don't apply. If you are using a substance infusion that requires a saving throw, a target attempts its save only once (even if it was hit multiple times), but it takes a penalty on the save equal to the number of times it was hit beyond the first.

  <p>Otherwise, if your blast hits, both the thrown creature and the target take the full amount of damage from your telekinetic blast, and the thrown creature falls <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a> in the last unoccupied space along its path. If your blast misses, the thrown creature can choose to occupy any space within 30 feet of the target, it doesn't fall <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>, and it takes half the normal amount of damage from your blast.

Make a single <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack roll</a> against each creature or object in a 30-foot line, starting with the closest target. If the result is a critical threat, roll to confirm against only the first target you hit. Calculate damage against each target you hit, starting from the closest. If your attack hits a target but fails to deal physical damage to that target, the spike fails to penetrate and the infused blast doesn't continue. A blast with the impale infusion can penetrate solid barriers, but it must deal enough damage to destroy the barrier in order to continue through.

  <p>You form a weapon using your kinetic abilities. You create a nonreach, light or one-handed weapon in your hand formed of pure energy or elemental matter. (If you're a telekineticist, you instead transfer the power of your kinetic blast to any object held in one hand.) The kinetic blade's shape is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect the damage dice, critical threat range, or critical multiplier of the kinetic blade, nor does it grant the kinetic blade any weapon special features. The object held by a telekineticist for this form infusion doesn't prevent her from using gather power.</p>
  <p>You can use this form infusion once as part of an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action in order to make melee attacks with your kinetic blade. Since it's part of another action (and isn't an action itself), using this wild talent doesn't provoke any additional <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>. The kinetic blade deals your kinetic blast damage on each hit (applying any modifiers to your kinetic blast's damage as normal, but not your <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> modifier). The blade disappears at the end of your turn. The weapon deals the same damage type that your kinetic blast deals, and it interacts with <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class">Armor Class</a> and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a> as normal for a blast of its type. Even if a telekineticist uses this power on a magic weapon or another unusual object, the attack doesn't use any of the magic weapon's bonuses or effects and simply deals the telekineticist's blast damage. The kinetic blade doesn't add the damage bonus from elemental overflow.</p>

Since kinetic fist is part of another action, using this wild talent doesn't provoke any additional <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. You deal an additional 1d6 points of damage per 3 dice of your kinetic blast's damage (minimum 1d6), and this damage is of the same type as your kinetic blast's damage. This extra damage ignores <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a> and doesn't apply any modifiers to your kinetic blast's damage, such as your <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier.</p>

You also gain the protection from cold of a warm <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fire-shield" style="font-style:italic">fire shield</a>. An attack that would deal an amount of cold damage equal to at least double your kineticist level (before you applied the protection) freezes away your flame shield after you apply its protection, ending the flame shield early.</p>

At the start of your next turn, unless the ash has been completely destroyed, you arise in the square where the most ash is located, having taken the damage from the triggering effect but having also healed 5 points of damage per kineticist level you possess.</p>

The face you select must be supported by the ground, and the kinetic cover cannot support more than 5 pounds of weight. Water, ice, and telekinetic force are translucent, but earth, metal, mud, and the like are opaque and block line of sight. A creature who strikes the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover">cover</a> can easily destroy it.
